          <h3>Our Little Story</h3>
          <p>
            I wasn’t expecting anything special when I logged into COD that
            day...
          </p>

            <p>
              I wasn’t expecting anything special when I logged into COD that
              day. Just another match, hoping to play with Moyo again, because
              there was never a dull moment with him around. Though I didn’t
              invite, and I didn’t even talk a lot. I still wasn’t fully
              comfortable, but I was still happy.
            </p>
            <p>
              That’s when Moyo invited someone new to the lobby, his friend. I
              didn’t think much of it at first. Just another teammate. But the
              moment he joined, something shifted. He had this calm energy, kind
              of quiet but confident. I liked it. I didn’t know it yet, but the
              person who just dropped into our match would become the one I’d
              eventually fall for.
            </p>
            <p>
              There was something about his voice that made me want to hear it
              more. At first, I dismissed it, thinking it was one of those times
              where I would find a guy attractive but forget their existence
              since I never get to meet nor talk to them after that first
              encounter. A few days went by as we played together. Honestly, I
              never really expected to play with him again, so soon and so
              frequently.
            </p>
            <p>
              I had noticed a few things about him, but I never really tried to
              figure out what kind of a person he was. From the few words we
              exchanged, I could tell he always spoke a little awkwardly with
              me. It felt like our energies didn’t quite align. And that made me
              sad, because in some strange way, I could tell we were similar in
              how we spoke to people.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn’t want to get close. I worried it would be awkward,
              uncomfortable, like trying to force something that wasn’t there.
              It reminded me of a time I finally talked to a girl I really
              wanted to be friends with, only to realize our conversation kept
              falling flat because we were both too awkward. That relationship
              never grew, and deep down, I was afraid the same thing would
              happen with him. But I still I blushed a little, whenever he
              talked to me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was happy when he sent me a friend request, it felt nice, like
              maybe he wanted to know me better. But at the same time, I still
              felt like it was easier when there were other people in the lobby.
              Just the two of us felt… awkward. I wouldn’t know what to say, and
              I didn’t want to feel pressured to talk just to fill the silence.
            </p>
            <p>
              At some point I secretly hoped that he was like Moyo. Someone
              talkative and not too awkward, alas that was only wishful thinking
              so I sticked to only playing with him when other people were
              there.
            </p>
            <p>
              Some days when I got to the game, I would always notice that he
              came online late. And during the day he was unavailable. I didn’t
              think much about it until it happened more frequently. It made be
              sad, that sometimes I would want to sleep when he just joined in.
              At that point the tension I felt between us had lessened, so I
              asked why he came in so late.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was surprised to find out he lived a whole continent away. I had
              thought he lived in SA this whole time, but my guess was wrong.
              And Nigerian too? Wow. I couldn’t really do anything about it, so
              I didn’t dwell on it too much.
            </p>
            <p>
              Our relationship progressed really good, and it made me happy. At
              some point I felt comfortable inviting him to my lobby and the
              awkwardness didn’t bother me as it did before. I enjoyed playing
              with him and I was happy to know he did too.
            </p>
            <p>
              At the time I had thought of him as one of my friends, not too
              close but I did feel a bond and that made me happy. The way he
              talked to me felt… nice. Even though sometimes it felt like he was
              talking to a child which I didn’t mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then one night when we were playing together, he asked for my
              number. It made me feel nice inside, but there was a lingering
              fear in my heart, so I declined. I felt a bit guilty for not
              giving him but stood firm on my word.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then he sent his number instead in the chat. I was honestly
              conflicted with myself. When he left the lobby, I stayed there for
              a few good minutes contemplating on if I should save it or not. I
              cursed myself and took his numbers.
            </p>
            <p>
              I sent a text to him still knowing what I was doing wasn’t right.
              At some point I teased him, making him think I was angry at
              something he didn’t mean to do. It was honestly cute, the way he
              tried to protect himself, trying to make it up to me like I was
              his girlfriend. Cuteness overload. As we continued talking, I
              noticed that my worst fear was coming true. And it made me sad. I
              felt so stupid and horrible inside.
            </p>
            <p>
              As days went by, we didn’t play as much as we used to. I really
              missed that, the games, the presence, the little moments, but
              there wasn’t much I could do. I had warned him what giving my
              number would mean, and even then, he still wanted it. But in the
              end, I was the one who messaged first… so I blamed myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              At least I found solace in talking to him on WhatsApp. Even if we
              weren’t gaming like before, our chats felt like a little place I
              could go to, just us, no pressure. His messages were simple,
              sometimes awkward, but there was something comforting about them.
              I didn’t always know what to say, but I wanted to keep the
              conversations going.
            </p>
            <p>
              Days went by, and there was less and less to talk about. I found
              myself running out of things to say, and eventually, I just
              stopped trying to start conversations, I didn’t want it to feel
              forced. Talking to him had been nice, but I wasn’t attached, so
              when things faded, I just let it happen. There wasn’t much to feel
              about it.
            </p>
            <p>
              I moved on with my life, but life started to be unfair. My family
              had fell apart. I had someone I thought I could confide in, but
              something felt off. They listened, sure, but from a distance. Like
              they didn’t really want to hear my problems, like they were trying
              to stay out of it. They never said it directly, but I could feel
              it in the way they brushed things off, and in how quickly they
              tried to move on from the conversation.
            </p>
            <p>
              I didn’t realize it then. I was overwhelmed and holding everything
              in. But now, looking back, it’s so clear, like night and day. I
              truly wished for someone else I could confide in. He came into
              mind, but I didn’t want to burden someone I barely knew with my
              problems. Things eventually settled down but there was always that
              lingering fear that things might flare up again.
            </p>
            <p>
              The person I had thought and cared about, drifted away, little by
              little. I didn’t understand why, and I wanted them to explain and
              asked them to stay. But it was all in vain. I cried for weeks
              without end. Falling into despair. I felt broken and alone. I
              sought out comfort and the person I had stopped talking to, he was
              the only person that came to mind.
            </p>
            <p>
              I was scared to message him at first. I felt guilty, like I was
              only reaching out to use him as an escape from all the pain I was
              carrying. All I wanted was to vent, to cry, to be heard… but it
              felt unfair to put that weight on him, so I held back.
            </p>
            <p>
              Days passed, and eventually, I gathered the courage to message
              him. And when I did, it felt like being pulled back from the edge,
              like someone had reached out and saved me from drowning. Just
              talking to him made me feel warmer.
            </p>
            <p>
              Gradually, our relationship began to grow again. I felt lighter,
              even though the stress and pain of everything I’d gone through was
              still there. Somehow, he gave me this sense of calm and happiness,
              just by being there. He didn’t even realize it, but he was helping
              me heal. And for that, I am truly grateful.
            </p>
            <p>As the distance between us lessened, the happier I felt.</p>
            <p>
              The late-night calls getting know each other, the good morning
              texts, it felt like utter bliss. A dream I never wanted to wake up
              from. There were moments where we didn’t know what to talk about,
              and sometimes it felt awkward and weird, but I didn’t care about
              that anymore. I would always try to figure out a way for us to
              talk, because I wanted to cling to the feelings, he made me feel.
            </p>
            <p>
              His voice, calm like the ocean waters, filled with warmth and
              sincerity. Leaving me dazed from time to time. With a bit of weird
              and awkwardness mixed in, but I liked it. His presence was soft
              and welcoming. At some point I truly thought he was God sent, and
              I still do. Like how can such a kind and wonderful person go
              through so much pain and hardship at an early age?
            </p>
            <p>
              Time goes by and our relationship grows stronger and harder. I
              didn’t know where this would lead me, but I didn’t dwell on it as
              I felt happy talking to him and it was the only thing I cared
              about.
            </p>
            <p>
              When he asked me to be his Valentine, I felt overjoyed as I had
              never really had one. Even though we weren’t officially together
              and there was an immeasurable amount of distance between, I didn’t
              care and was really looking forward to that day.
            </p>
            <p>
              The more our relationship advanced, the more I wanted him for
              myself. But I was scared because of the distance between us. At
              some point I had promised myself that I wouldn’t be in a
              long-distance relationship again because of the emotional trauma I
              had experienced while being in it, but there I was falling for a
              man I wasn’t even sure I would see in this life. I felt conflicted
              and pained.
            </p>
            <p>
              Even though I wanted to, I still felt like it was useless to even
              try since it would be near impossible for us to be together,
              physically. I couldn’t feel his warmth, his breath over my neck,
              his face close to mine, my hand in his, a hug and his hand on my
              head. (physical contact with Other humans is traumatizing lol)
            </p>
            <p>
              My feelings were still uncertain, but I wanted to know how he
              felt, so I asked him to be my boyfriend. The moment I sent the
              text, I felt stupid and embarrassed for asking. He didn’t really
              accept. It hurt, even just a little, but strangely, I also felt
              relieved. I let it go and tried to move on, reminding myself that,
              even if only for a short while, I was still his Valentine. For
              that moment, I was his, and that was enough.
            </p>
            <p>
              Life went on as normal, and I was happy. Then Valentines Day came.
              I was ecstatic and I wanted to be with him desperately, but alas,
              that was just a fleeting dream. But I sought out to find my
              Valentine. Where is he I wondered. With my great detective skills,
              I was able to find him. Playing with his friends. I felt a bit
              angry and jealous. Angry because I thought he forgot and jealous
              because I wanted him to play with me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I know I was being selfish, but I didn’t care as only emotions
              were driving me. It was only about what my heart wanted but at the
              end, I understood he was playing with his friends and so I asked
              to talk to him for a few minutes, but we ended up playing together
              and my heart was just dancing with joy. The moment felt surreal, I
              hadn’t had that much fun in ages.
            </p>
            <p>
              Then later that night he said yes. I was confused and scared at
              what he implied. When he said he wanted to make it official, I
              froze. I never expected him to say that. My feelings wavering, and
              fear crept in. But I chose to trust in him. I knew he wasn’t the
              kind of person to make a big decision like that without thinking
              it through thoroughly. I knew that. Considering the distance
              between us made everything feel almost impossible… I wanted to
              believe in him. In us.
            </p>
            <p>When he said he loved me, I couldn’t say it back.</p>
            <p>
              I wanted to. But I was scared. I felt guilty. like I was breaking
              an unspoken rule by staying silent. I had already said yes to
              being his, but my heart wasn’t ready to speak those words.
            </p>
            <p>
              And yet… he never pressured me. He didn’t ask why. He just kept
              showing up, steady and kind, like he understood without needing an
              explanation. That silence, his silence, made me feel safe. And
              slowly, I began to realize…
            </p>
            <p>His love was gentle. It never demanded. It waited.</p>
            <p>
              Over time, something inside me began to shift. It wasn’t sudden.
              It wasn’t dramatic. Just small things, the way he spoke to me, how
              he always listened, how he never made me feel like I had to be
              anything more than myself.
            </p>
            <p>
              And as the days passed, I found myself thinking about him more,
              not just when I was sad or lonely, but when I’m happy too. I
              started missing him when I smile, when I laughed, when things were
              okay. That’s when I knew something had changed. Eventually I was
              ready. I told him I love him. Out loud. Not just for me to hear,
              but for him to hear it too. Not just me, not anymore.
            </p>
            <p>
              Not just to fill the silence, but to make it real, to give the
              words the weight they deserved. Because I finally meant them, with
              all of me.
            </p>
            <p>
              I still wonder why he chose to be with me, someone so far away,
              instead of someone closer, someone easier to love.
            </p>
            <p>
              I try to understand, and I do in some way… but I also don’t. I
              keep thinking,
              <i
                >what was going through your mind when you decided you wanted
                me?</i
              >
            </p>
            <p>
              Was it something I said? The way I listened? The silence I filled
              without trying to? I don’t know.But whatever it was, you chose me.
              And even with all the distance, all the uncertainty… you stayed.
            </p>
            <p>
              A seed was planted the day I first met you, small, uncertain,
              barely noticeable.
            </p>
            <p>
              And now, it’s grown into something beautiful. A quiet, blooming
              flower.
            </p>
            <p>
              I’ll do my best to nurture it, to care for this love, just as you

              I don’t know what the future holds. The distance, the waiting,
              it’s not easy. But I hope one day, we’ll look back on all of this
              and smile, knowing we made it through.

              One day, maybe I won’t have to miss you through a screen. One day,
              I’ll reach out and hold your hand for real. And when that day
              comes, I’ll know the flower we cared for, against all odds, was
              always meant to bloom.

            It’s rainy. We’re in our little corner café, your laptop’s open and

            your croissant. That’s it—that’s the dream.
